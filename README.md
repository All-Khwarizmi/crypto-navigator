# BlockchainNavigator üß≠

> "Where can I buy this token?"
> "How do I move my assets across chains?"
> "What wallets do I need?"

## Vision

BlockchainNavigator transforms the complexity of cross-chain navigation into an educational journey. Instead of trying to abstract away blockchain complexity like most solutions, we embrace it and make it understandable.

## Problem

The blockchain ecosystem grows more complex every day:

- Multiple chains and Layer 2s
- Different wallet requirements
- Various exchanges and bridges
- Complex transfer requirements

This complexity is often seen as a problem. We see it as an opportunity for education.

## Solution

Think Google Maps for blockchain - but instead of just showing the route, we teach you how to navigate it:

üó∫Ô∏è **Visual Route Mapping**

- Clear path visualization
- Required wallets and accounts
- Step-by-step guidance

üìö **Educational Layer**

- Learn while doing
- Security checkpoints
- Best practices

üîç **Route Finding**

- Common token paths
- Exchange requirements
- Cost estimation

## Key Differentiators

- **Education First**: Turn complexity into learning opportunity
- **Visual Learning**: Map-based interface for intuitive understanding
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, reveal depth as needed
- **Real Utility**: Solve immediate needs while building knowledge

## MVP Focus

Phase 1: Route Finding & Education

- Popular token path mapping
- Basic visual route representation
- Essential wallet/exchange requirements
- Core educational content

## Technical Stack

- Next.js + TypeScript
- React Flow for visualizations
- Mode Network integration
- CoinGecko API for token data

## Project Status

Currently in development with focus on:

1. Core route mapping engine
2. Basic visual interface
3. Educational content structure

## Roadmap

- [ ] Basic route visualization
- [ ] Common token paths
- [ ] Interactive requirements checker
- [ ] Educational content integration
- [ ] Price comparison features
- [ ] Advanced route optimization

## Target Users

1. Crypto Newcomers

   - Clear guidance
   - Educational support
   - Confidence building

2. Experienced Users
   - Route optimization
   - Quick path finding
   - Best price discovery

## Why Now?

With the explosion of new chains and Layer 2s, the need for clear navigation has never been greater. While others focus on abstraction, we focus on education and understanding.
